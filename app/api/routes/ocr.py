    """Extract one or more documents from a single multipart request into one merged response.

    `file`, `documentName`, and `documentType` are repeated fields paired by position, so every
    document carries the type its own dropdown selected. Every document is extracted and
    type-checked first; an incomplete National ID/passport/visa is not rejected immediately but held
    to see whether another uploaded file of the same type supplies its missing side - if so, and
    Gemini confirms the two genuinely are the same document, they are merged into one before
    validation continues (see `resolve_incomplete_pairs` in app.services.ocr_pipeline). Every resulting document then runs
    self-verification, and any problem anywhere - a type mismatch, a document nothing else can
    complete, an ambiguous pairing, a rejected pairing, or a self-verification finding - stops the
    whole request immediately: the response is exactly the same shape a single document has always
    returned, `data` empty and the reason in `errorInfo`, never a partial result for the documents
    that were fine. Only once every uploaded document has individually passed does cross-verification
    run across all of them (skipped entirely for a single document, since there is nothing to compare
    it against) - another failure there stops the request the same way. Only once the whole batch has
    cleared every one of those gates, including cross-verification, does the crop/rotate pipeline
    run, for every document at once: an error anywhere in the batch means none of them is ever
    cropped or rotated. Only then are every document's own fields folded into that one response: a
    National ID's National_Id, a passport's Passport_Number, a visa's Visa_Number, all landing in the
    same `data` object beside each other, exactly the schema a single-document upload has always
    used - never a per-document breakdown, never a new key.
